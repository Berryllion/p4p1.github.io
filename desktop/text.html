I might be doing this for nothing but whatever....
                So yeah I'm sorry hon. I really love you but after everything with my parents
                me putting myself on the line with my mum and fighting with her
                physicaly so that you could be accepted as my gf, Me also fighting
                with my dad the night you came sleeping in england so that he understands
                I really love you... After all that shit I was really down mentaly.
                In my life I was this low mentaly (when my parents separated and my mum was on the streets
                and I had to figure out at 8 how I was gonna make it) so many times I'm used to it thats why you
                didnt see much of what I trully felt. I learned how to hide my pain when I was younger
                because of my parents. But after all that happened between me and my parents,
                I wasnt the same I am more mature now I know that I should just enjoy
                simple things in life and stop trying to fight everyone and everything.
                So I'm really angry against you because I feel like I thought throught
                the hardest part of my life with you and you just kept on complaining like a child
                whereas me I was alone with a broken hart and nothing to hang on to other than a complaining child.
                I really wish you could have been a bit more mature and that you could have seen how hard it was for me.
                But whatever life is life... And I'm just an unlucky ass hole.
                Anyway, after all the fights that I did with my parents for you I couldnt take much
                and when I saw that you cut your' leg because of me. My heart sank. I feel in destress since
                I dont know what to do, I have feeling scattered everywhere in my brain without knowing what to do
                so I chose to leave, So I crushed my own heart so that I could be good on my own, but I got lost inside of my
                mind, I had to get out of where I was thats why I came back to you after your' birthday. I needed someone
                I have love Inside for you, And I had to give to you. So thats when we did the 2 months of Jun/Jully
                I spent those 2 month happy as I never was in my life, Thank you so much you gave me the love I needed
                But after those two months you where back to your' regular self and we started to fight again.
                I am already hurt really bad inside after everything with my parents so I had
                to give up. I'm really sorry. It's such a shame to waist 2 years of fighting, but yeah
                thats my life and I'm not over with it.
                I just want you to find yourself a nice man so that next year it wont be wierd, if
                we work together. I don't want to lose you I just need air for now because
                I really feel bad. Maybey in a few years on my yaught we will be together but for now
                I need to make it alone.
                Thank you for reading, I'm sorry I made you cry.
